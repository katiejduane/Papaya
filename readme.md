## About Papaya!

I'm made this project for a few reasons:

1. I thought it might be nice to have a project organizer for my excessive amounts of projects, spanning poetry, paintings, and web development. (I was wrong, once I was finished, it just felt like one more thing to manage!)

2. I wanted more practice with React and Redux

3. I wanted a deeper understanding of Auth, and to do it from scratch myself, using JWT.

4. To learn an ORM, Sequelize!
