## About Papaya!

I made this project for a few reasons:

1. I thought it might be nice to have a project organizer for my excessive amounts of projects, spanning poetry, paintings, and web development. (I was wrong, once I was finished with this, using it just felt like one more thing to manage!)

2. I wanted more practice with React and Redux

3. I wanted a deeper understanding of Auth, and to do it from scratch myself, using JWT.

4. To learn Sequelize!

## Status:

This project is about 97% done. There is some styling that needs to be completed, and it needs to be deployed. BUT: I've been working on it on-and-off for over a year and have grown a lot in my skills, and have decided to leave it at 97% so I can move on to learning and building new things. I'm grateful for all this project taught me, which was A LOT. If I have the free time in the future, I'd love to finish the styling and learn Heroku in order to deploy it :)
