## About Papaya!

I'm building this application for two reasons:

1. I kind of need it, personally. As an artist/writer/coder with an endless stream of ideas and projects I'm working on, I often lose track of where I'm at in each project. I've tried notebooks, charts, and lists--but nothing works as fantastically as I'd like. I hope that a simple visual interface that can easily be organized (using a filter) by project type or status (which stage of the creative process it is in) will allow me (and other creative types!) to work more efficiently, and more importantly: FINISH MORE PROJECTS :)

2. I loved learning React during my bootcamp, but it was SO quick and we really got a solid foundation more than an in-depth understanding. I've completed a couple online courses/tutorials since graduating, and wanted to make another React/Redux application in order to really cement and personalize what I've learned. 

Since this is still in its early stages, I'll just say: more detailed notes to come soon!
