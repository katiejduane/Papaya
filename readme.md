## About Papaya!

I'm building this application for three reasons:

1. Personally, I kind of need it. As an artist/writer/coder with an endless stream of ideas and projects I'm working on, I often lose track of where I'm at in each project. I've tried notebooks, charts, and lists--but nothing works as fantastically as I'd like. I hope that a simple visual interface that can easily be organized (using a filter) by project type or status (which stage of the creative process it is in) will allow me (and other creative types!) to work more efficiently, and more importantly: FINISH MORE PROJECTS :)

2. React was my favorite part of the curriculum during my time at DigitalCrafts, but it was SO quick and there is SO much to learn, so we built a solid foundation of understanding to leap from. After graduating, I was reapy to leap, and I've completed a couple of online courses/tutorials since. I wanted to make another React/Redux application in order to really cement and personalize what I've learned so far. 

3. I also wanted to improve my understanding of SQL, and learn Sequelize.

This is still in its early stages :]
