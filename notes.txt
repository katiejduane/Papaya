ideas: not a list, but "cards" (option to upload/link image?),
each card has project name, media/type, category, state (idea/in-progress/revision/
completed/submitted/accepted).

ex)
name: basalt
genre: writing (options: do i give them? or allow them to create? writing/visual art)
type/media: essay (they input this)
state: revision (options: idea)
completed: false
submitted: false
accepted: false

onclick--opens to see details (like notes, etc) and also edit
or add more info if they want, or move to new list (w/ button!)

will also have a submit button to take them to submittable (i hope,
not sure if this is allowed, will have to read their docs)

drop-down menus/buttons will allow them to filter/see their lists by...
genre, state, maybe type, too, but would have to be dynamic from backend

cards could be color-coded by project type? and/or by where they are 
in the process?
